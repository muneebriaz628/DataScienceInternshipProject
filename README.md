## Overview  
This repository contains four key projects developed during the Data Science Internship aiming to build predictive and NLP models in different domains:

- **Employee Attrition Prediction:** Classification models to predict if employees will leave and provide HR retention strategies.  
- **Text Summarization:** Generate concise summaries from long articles using extractive and abstractive methods.  
- **Disease Diagnosis Prediction:** Predict the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease for early detection.  
- **Loan Default Prediction:** Identify high-risk loan applicants to reduce defaults using financial data.
